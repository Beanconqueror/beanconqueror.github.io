    content: "This app is awesome! It is the only app I could find that’s completely free. There are no features hidden behind a paywall and there are zero ads in the app! Amazing support and care by the developer. There are tons of features in this app and almost all of them are customizable. You will never have to guess how to make that perfect cup/shot again when using this app. It’s super easy to use and navigate around, the sharing feature is fantastic. It simply shares an image of your brew with all the stats and doesn’t send a link to download the app, a small feature I love! I enjoy the ability to add pictures of what I’m using. There are so many features in this app I haven’t gotten to yet, and the ones I have used are great. Definitely a must-have app"

    content: "I have tried a few apps and while many of them have some cute features, nothing comes close to the breadth of customization and integration that this app offers. I primarily use it for espresso and I’m on a simple setup with a GCP but this app grows with me after time I add a price of equipment for tweak a variable. The developer seems super knowledgeable and in touch with the coffee geeks. They’re constantly making USEFUL updates and offering more customizable parameters for us to tweak. Can’t recommend this app highly enough!"

    content: "This is a beautifully designed app. It looks clean, clear and simple, but it packs A TON of functionality. There is a setting for everything and even more. You can dial in on your coffee as you wish and then move it across to this app to your liking. Best part - even though it offers bazillion options and settings, somehow it’s super intuitive to use and well explained. Tipping the developer seems a must since this app IS TOTALLY FREE and with NO ADS. Massive respect!"

    content: "This app is absolutely fantastic for coffee fanatics. No more excel spreadsheets, or chicken scratch in notebooks or losing recipes. Everything from brew recipes to cataloguing all the beans you purchase, they let you document all the smallest details and this is highly appreciated coming from a note-taking obsessive. It’s incredibly intuitive and easy to jot down your brew recipes and give them a rating. If you ever want to recreate a recipe, filter through your past brews or give a quick scroll and you can find all the details to a favorite recipe for a particular method or coffee bean. They have those game-like tracking statistics where you can see how much you’ve spent on coffee or a pie chart of your favourite brew methods. Trivial things like the amount of beans you have left and how long you’ve gone since your last coffee. I live for stuff like this, makes coffee brewing even more fun. You can effortlessly change brew methods and customize your parameters, even something as mundane as changing the order in which the information is shown. They didn’t need to make all of the small things customizable but they did the extra work to make that happen just so users have that freedom. You can clearly tell that they are coffee enthusiasts who are putting in all the features and details they wanted, except they actually had the expertise to make a fully functioning app. This is a FREE app and I definitely wouldn’t mind tossing them some money just as a donation. Not only is the app incredibly functional, the UI/UX design is very minimalistic and beautiful. Uncluttered with ads or distracting designs, it really is a pleasure to use daily as you track your progress. I love the cute, small icons for the brewing equipment and the soft colour palette they’ve chosen. I hope that the app developers continue adding in new equipment like pour over espresso makers (Cafelat, Flair) and Lever machines. As I first heard of this app on Homebarista, I know that that one of the creators of this app frequents the forum and asks users for any input. Bug reports, features users want or simply just their thoughts on the app, the devs are very committed to making the app the best it can be and always striving to make it better. I am excited to use this app for years to come and look back on all the different coffee varietals, roasters, brew methods and equipment I’ve experimented with. I look forward to all the exciting updates and new features which will make this golden app even better."

    content: "Great job by the developers to ensure that this remains a clean and focused app without unnecessary clutter. The ability to customize the workflow to exactly what I need without any other noise is incredible and has earned the app a firm part of my mornings. Keep it coming!"

    content: "I’ve been using Beanconqueror for a long time now, and always find new ways to tinker with the settings so that each section is exactly aligned to what I want it to look like and contain. The amount of flexibility the app offers is unmatched! I also love the Bluetooth integration of scales and refractometers, so I can track as many of the stats of the brews I make as I can to deepen my understanding of extraction. I suggest making monthly exported backups, as all data is stored on your phone and nothing is automatically backed up to a server (good for privacy!). 10/10, you’ve killed it Lars. Thank you!"

This app makes dialing in espresso so much easier and fun! Amazing app, highly recommend to all coffee enthusiasts!"

    content: "This app is amazing. It has just about every feature you could want, from beginner to extremely advanced data collection. All FOR FREE??? I’m just so surprised at how well thought out and well made it is. If there was a paid tier or subscription to support the devs I’d buy it in a heartbeat, this is hands down the best app for any data collection and storage."

    content: "This app is, without question, the ultimate app for tracking brews and all the other details you could possibly want to know. Which water recipe you use the most? ✅ Which grinder you use the most? ✅ Statistics on brewer usage, beans ground, spend on beans, with charts month on month? ✅ Tasting notes adding to brews? ✅ Repeating previous brews at the touch of a button? ✅ I could go on, the work done here is phenomenal and the fact it’s an ongoing community effort means it’s only going to grow and improve over time."
