The synchronization of data or login functionality is an often asked feature.

This topic is a big big thing, which will led into a user login in the end, which needs really much development aswell as testing. (Offline / Online synchronisation, File sync (Photo, Raw data from Bluetooth devices,...) etc.)

As much as I'd love to do this, as less time I've for this at the moment. Given solutions like from iOS or Android are not suitable on the actual solution inside Beanconqueror, which has been tested out on my side.

The plugin  just stores JSON-Data but doesn't sync files, also the plugin has an issue when it comes to bigger JSON-structures, which will come over time

In the end, there also comes the situation, that with a user login, more infrastructure/server needs to exist, which needs to be paid.

So, I'm sorry, but this is a feature which will not come in the near future.
