Beanconqueror operates entirely offline on your device, meaning all data is stored locally on your phone. While we take great care with updates and conduct extensive testing, certain issues may arise on specific setups that we are unable to test. 

If this happens, please NEVER uninstall the application before performing a full backup, as doing so would result in complete data loss upon reinstallation.

 

In case of data loss, similarly, do NOT uninstall the application. Instead, contact us directly at info@beanconqueror.com to address the issue. Additionally, Beanconqueror performs regular automatic backups, retaining data from the past seven days. In most cases, you can simply import a backup to restore your data.Adding to this, Beanconqueror is doing a lot of auto backups which lead back to 7 days, so most of the time you just can import a backup and all data are there again.
