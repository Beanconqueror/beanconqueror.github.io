###### What has been fixed?
- Bean-sharing link has been fixed again.
- Autostart from pressure threshold sometimes ended in an stop after some seconds, because the weight of the scale still reported like 150g in the first 0.1s/0.2s, and therefore auto stop logic from Beanconqueror triggered.
- Fixing listening mode for the AKU Micro scale, to not start immediately when weight was not zero.
- Removing multiple unneeded permissions which came from the migration from Cordova to Capacitor which somehow slipped. - Just Android. Thanks @RagingCactus for the continuous support here.
   - Using the Capacitor-App Launcher instead of InAppBrowser (which required a lot of unneeded permissions) - Just Android. Thanks @RagingCactus for this change.
- Added some more loggings for NFC, after some NFC-Chips didn't work.
