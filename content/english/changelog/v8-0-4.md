###### What has been fixed/changed?
- iOS Screenshot is working again
- You can sort your beans now for remaining weight
- Varia AKU Mini is now supported (Maybe Varia needs to publish a new Firmware)
- Specially for poor performance devices: An experimental feature has been added, where you can set the refresh-rate of the graph to minimize lagging
- You can enable a new setting for "1 of 2 cups on the scale", if you want to do a split shot, but your scale just can handle one scale - The function will double the incoming weight.
- You can now select a connection mode for Acaia scales on iOS. If you're experiencing issues with older models and the new connection routine, you can revert to the previous "V1" mode in the settings.
