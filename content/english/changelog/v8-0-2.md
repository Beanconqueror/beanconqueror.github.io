###### What has been fixed?
- On Android with specific setups Acaia scales had a connect/disconnect loop - I've switched back the connection logic to the old routine)
(Sidenote: For iOS there where no reportings, and they will still take the new connection way, which has been tested on a iPhone 15 and iPad 10 with Pearl S and Lunar 2021 without encountering those)
- On iOS I've set up the delay to show "no weight" to 4 sec instead of 2.5, because on test side the weight has been sent, but when connecting the first time, it sometimes took 3 sec (where the popup already has been displayed)
