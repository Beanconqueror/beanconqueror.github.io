If you would like to contribute and you are not yet registered as a translator, please contact info@beanconqueror.com

The translation with lokalise is quite simple. You will get access to one or multiple source language and the target language, you will translate to.

These are the different areas of the translation tool (see screenshot):

1. This allows you to filter for "untranslated" keys (words or sentences).
2. This is the name of the key
3. This is the word or sentence in the source language
4. Add your translation here
5. Translation tools from DeepL, Google Translate and Microsoft Translate can help you. There is even an AI option available. Please just check if the translation makes sense if you use these options, as there are words with different translation options. If you translate beans for example - the word for green beans (in the target language) might not be the right choice :-)

Usually release notes for older releases are NOT translated, as only the notes for the latest release is shown.

Please do not translate any tags or placeholders for example <b> or {{filename}}

Also if the source language has "Empty" in the field it can be skipped. See screenshots.

Hide old changelogs by filter

If you want to hide old changelogs directly you can also choose a saved filter from me, which I update after each update.
