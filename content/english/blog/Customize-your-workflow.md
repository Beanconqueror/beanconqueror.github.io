Beanconqueror tries to give the user the maximum of freedom by allowing them to customize the parameters that are used. Most parameters can be enabled or disabled. This makes the app a fitting option for beginners as well as professionals.

There are some important key aspects to understand first:
You can customize the global parameter (Menu → Brew parameters), aswell as customizing your preparation method parameters.

The global parameter will be taken for all preparations, but are overwritten from a customized preparation method.

Now Beanconqueror differs between different things:

1. Manage parameters → Which parameter you want to see when adding/editing
2. Sort parameters → In which order shall the parameter being displayed.
3. Define default parameters → When you open up a new brew, which parameters shall be preset from the brew before
    a. If you active “Bean” e.g., and add a new brew, the last used Bean will be preset.
4. Define repeat parameters → When you repeat a brew, which parameters shall be preset? Default: All
5. List view parameters → Which information shall be displayed on the brew-list (Not when Adding / Editing or on the Detail view)

 

And now comes the clue:
You want to have different workflows, parameters or preset for your preparation method.
You can goto Preparation Methods → Choose the preparation method → “…” → Customize parameters → Activate now “Use custom parameters”.

1. Manage parameters → Global parameters are now overwritten
2. Default → You need to activate this, to overwrite the global parameters
3. Sort parameters → Global parameters are now overwritten
4. List view parameters → Global parameters are now overwritten
5. Repeat → You need to activate this, to overwrite the global parameters
