Beanconqueror is still searching actively for more translators! If you're passionate about coffee and have skills in translation, we'd love for you to join our community of contributors. We're using a fantastic tool called Lokalise to streamline the translation process, making it easy and fun to contribute.

Your contributions will help us make Beanconqueror accessible to even more coffee enthusiasts around the world. Every bit of help counts, whether it's translating a few strings or reviewing existing translations.
