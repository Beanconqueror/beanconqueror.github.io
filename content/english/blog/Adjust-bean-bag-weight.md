You bought a bean bag lets say 250grams, and you gave away 100gram, and you want to adjust the bean bag weight without reducing the whole 250 grams?

What you can do?

1. Create dummy method & grinder and sunk in here all the data.
2. Activate "Bean weight" (Goto Menu → Brewing parameters → Manage parameters → Activate bean weight), if you do your next shot, set like bean weight -> 10 grams, grind weight -> 18 grams. -> The Brew-Ratio will still be correct, but it will subtract 10 grams instead of 18 grams on your bean-bag.
