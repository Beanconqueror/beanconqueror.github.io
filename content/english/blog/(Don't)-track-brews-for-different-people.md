Beanconqueror is not made for tracking shots for different people in this case.
But what you can do:

1. Create dummy method & grinder and sunk in here all the data.
2. Activate "Bean weight", if you do your next shot, set like bean weight -> 80 grams, grind weight -> 18 grams. -> The Brew-Ratio will still be correct, but it will subtract 80grams instead of 18 grams on your bean-bag
