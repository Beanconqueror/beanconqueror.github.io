## Concept

Beanconqueror combines the most important things you need to make a good coffee (Brew):

- Beans
- Brewing/ Preparation Methods
- Grinders

### Brews

The brew brings everything together.

### Beans

Your coffee bean

### Methods

Preparation methods describe the way you prepare your coffee

You can set customized parameters for each individually preparation method.

### Grinders

The grinder

 

## This looks to much?

You can realy reduce for the start and expand later.

Adding a bean? → A name is enough

Adding a preparation method? → Just choose a given one

Adding a grinder → A name is enough

Now you can already start your first brew and start to understand which parameters took effect on your brew taste.
Also if you’re starting the app, and doing this all on the welcoming page, you can already start your brew winking face
