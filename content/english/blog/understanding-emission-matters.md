## The Value of Transparency: Why Understanding Emissions Matters
> This article was created by Kaffeemacher in collaboration with Beanconqueror to celebrate the introduction of the new kg CO₂e per kg roasted coffee parameter—bringing greater transparency to coffee emissions.

Knowing the carbon footprint of coffee allows us to quantify and compare emissions per cup. Beyond data, this transparency fosters awareness, enabling consumers to make informed choices. Interestingly, sustainability can even subconsciously influence taste perception.

## What are CO₂e?

The carbon footprint of coffee is measured in **kilograms of CO₂e (carbon dioxide equivalents) per kilogram of coffee**. CO₂e represents the **global warming potential (GWP)** of all greenhouse gases combined. While CO₂ is the most common, gases like methane and nitrous oxide also contribute to climate impact. By converting them into CO₂-equivalents, we provide a standardized unit to assess emissions across different sources.

## Where Do Emissions Come From?

Coffee emissions are generated throughout the supply chain, with **cultivation** being the dominant factor. However, methods, geography, and yields vary significantly—not just between farms but also from harvest to harvest.

- **Cultivation:** The most significant contributor. Some farms act as carbon sinks, absorbing more CO₂ than they emit, making their coffee climate-positive. In contrast, intensive monoculture farms relying heavily on fertilizers can exceed **30 kg CO₂e per kg of coffee**.
- **Transportation:** A comparatively smaller factor. However, optimizing logistics (e.g., using trains instead of trucks) can reduce emissions.
- **Roasting & Packaging:** Energy sources, roasting methods, and packaging materials influence the footprint of the final product.

### The Role of Transparency

By openly communicating emissions, we enable consumers to critically assess sustainability claims and distinguish real efforts from greenwashing. Awareness fosters better decision-making, allowing consumers to prioritize both taste and climate responsibility.

### The Emotional Topic of Packaging

Packaging is often a key focus in sustainability discussions, yet it accounts for only about **23% of a roastery’s emissions** (source: [Kaffeemacher](https://www.kaffeemacher.ch/blog/kaffeemacher-roesterei-unser-co2-fussabdruck/)) Where the impact of the roastery compared to the overall emissions are roughly 5 -20% depending on the practics at origin . Despite its relatively small footprint, material choices and the roastery’s energy sources significantly shape consumer perception. Roasteries embracing sustainable packaging take responsibility and invite their customers to engage in the conversation.

## An Overlooked Factor: Coffee Preparation

Most emission calculations stop at the point of sale, yet consumer choices heavily influence the overall footprint. Three key questions matter:

1. **What coffee do you buy?** Sustainable sourcing matters.
2. **How do you prepare it?** A **water kettle heating only what’s needed** is far more efficient than a dual boiler espresso machine left running continuously.
3. **What energy source do you use?** Green electricity dramatically reduces the impact compared to fossil fuels.

## The Four Key Emission Drivers for Roasteries

While cultivation remains the biggest contributor, roasteries have multiple levers to reduce their overall footprint:

### **Green Coffee Selection**

In this article we are focusing on the GWP, but choosing sustainable coffee goes beyond CO₂ values—social impact matters, too. A coffee with a slightly higher footprint can still be the more responsible choice if it ensures **better wages and improved living conditions** for producers.

### **Origin Trips**

Visiting farms strengthens relationships and ensures quality but generates emissions. Roasteries can **optimize travel frequency, combine trips, or explore digital alternatives** to reduce their footprint.

### **Roasting Operations**

Energy efficiency is key. The type of energy used (electricity, gas, renewables) greatly influences emissions. Investing in **modern, energy-efficient roasting technology** can drive significant reductions.

### **Packaging**

Despite its relatively small share in total emissions, packaging is a **highly visible factor**. Thoughtful material choices **minimize waste** while also communicating a commitment to sustainability.

## Making Emissions Tangible

By quantifying emissions, we enable both **comparability and accountability**. This transparency empowers consumers and roasteries to minimize their climate impact together—through **thoughtful sourcing, mindful consumption, and sustainable preparation**. Sustainability isn’t just a metric—it becomes a part of the overall coffee experience.
