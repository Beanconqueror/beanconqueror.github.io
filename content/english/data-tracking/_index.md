As stated in our [vision]() we want to be as transparent as possible. Especially when it comes to your data, the tracking concept, usage and with which tools we are working. We are not making any compromises here - promised.

The following page lists our tracking concept, including the parameters we track, so that you know what we are doing with your data and why. You always can check out the [source code on Github]() to see what's going on.

### The details
For our tracking, we use [Matomo](), a data-security and privacy focused open source service which is hosted on our own server. This ensures, that only we have the ownership of the collected and saved data.
